## Mantra

Slow, steady progress

## Plan

- Start with coding warmup
- Continue with Pic Story UI buildout: customization! (this is the whole reason I'm building this thing)

## Checklist

- Render custom classes from static app state: DONE! üëç
- Hook up app UI to state to toggle custom classes for real: DONE! üëç. We can now do this for text sizing. Next up: every other utility class category for Tailwind.
