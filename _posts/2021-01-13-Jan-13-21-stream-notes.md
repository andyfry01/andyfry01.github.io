## Monday and Tuesday

- Pretty rough altogether
	- Still getting used to Clojure, especially the environmental and tooling
	- Websockets, setting up a websocket server, learning how to use Reframe, it's a lot!
	- Too much newness can be discouraging

## Today

- Gonna focus on building some frontend templates
  - Good opportunity to use tech I have a good grasp on (CSS, HTML)
  - Good opportunity to practice and refine Clojure skills already acquired (http-kit, compjure, ring)

## Mantra

YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THE WHOLE PIE

## Things to do

- Get the old server back up and running - DONE 👍

- Define some super simple routes for templates - DONE 👍

- Make a templates module which serves hiccup HTML - DONE 👍

- Style them!

  - But which pages? 

    - plot input page - DONE 👍

    - voting page

    - results page

    - game lobby

    - login / signup page

    - user settings page
