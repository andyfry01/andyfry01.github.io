## Plan

- Start porting over our vanilla Hiccup/Tailwind templates into React/Reagent components
- Dip another toe into websockets, hook up our game logic functionality to our frontend!

## Mantra

Keep side effects and nasty code on the outside

## Loose agenda

- Port over game registration screen to React - DONE 👍
- Send a WS message for registration from React to backend - DONE 👍
