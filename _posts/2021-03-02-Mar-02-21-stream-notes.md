## Mantra
(a small idea to guide the day's work)

KISS - Keep it Simple Steven.
(I know it actually stands for something else)

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)

- Start with coding warmup
- Customize all the things! Within reason.

## What I got done
(plan != reality)

- Implement what we've done for text size for more class categories
    - Made good progress here! We can: 
        - Control text attributes of all kinds
        - Add gradients to our elements

## For next time
- Continue selecting/pruning Tailwind utility classes and add more customization options.
