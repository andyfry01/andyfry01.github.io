## News

LAST DAY!

... we're not gonna make it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

## Plan

- Start with warmup

- Continue hooking up websockets to game functions

- Maybe have a "month one revisited" feature somewhere down the road

## Mantra

  Maybe I wasn't working on the game after all ... 

## Agenda

- daily warmup 
- Websocket function hookup 👷‍♂️
  - Adding a player to the game - DONE 👍
  - listing current players who have joined the game - DONE 👍
  - submit a plot to the backend - DONE 👍
  - save that plot in the frontend state - next time 💃
