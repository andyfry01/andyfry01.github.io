excerpt: "Needs moar Tailwind"

## Mantra
(a small idea to guide the day's work)
Chill ðŸ›€

## Plan
(what do I plan to do)
- Add more Tailwind to the app

## What I got done
(plan != reality)
- Added more Tailwind to the app! In fact, I added all of the relevant, useful classes to the app in the form of dropdown menus. Stick a fork in it, that task is done ðŸš€

## For next time
- Start to polish up editing functionality, possibly start working with custom images instead of placeholder images.
