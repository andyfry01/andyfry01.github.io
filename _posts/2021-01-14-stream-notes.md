## Today

- Gonna focus on building some frontend templates
  - Good opportunity to use tech I have a good grasp on (CSS, HTML)
  - Good opportunity to practice and refine Clojure skills already acquired (http-kit, compjure, ring)

## Mantra

YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT THE WHOLE PIE

## Things to do

- Get the old server back up and running - DONE 👍

- Define some super simple routes for templates - DONE 👍

- Make a templates module which serves hiccup HTML - DONE 👍

- Style them!

  - But which pages? 

    - plot input page - DONE 👍

    - voting page - DONE 👍

    - results page - DONE 👍 .... And with a little bit of bonus functionality to boot!

      - List of players
